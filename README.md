# What is this?

This is my attempt a visualizing some of the spotify track features for Jesus Is King. I've been eager for any and all projects to further my learning and experience with D3 and this seemed like a good fit.

# Why Jesus Is King?

To be honest, my first impression of the album was so so. Then I listened to an episode of the podcast [Dissect](https://dissectpodcast.com/) where [Cole](https://twitter.com/dissectpodcast) and [Femi](https://twitter.com/oluwafemio) delved into the album and it just completely changed my opinion of the album. While I still think it can feel disjointed at parts, I'm convinced that it's telling a mature and well thought out story.
